Some basic files to have fun and to do proof on concepts using a Digispark board  
Requires Ardiono IDE  

NOTES  
****** DO NOT PLUG IN THE Digispark BEFORE YOU UPLOAD CODE IN THE IDE, IT WILL PROMPT YOU TO PLUG IN THE BOARD ******  

IDE will prompt with this:  
Running Digispark Uploader...  
Plug in device now... (will timeout in 60 seconds)  

- Have yet to get Arduino IDE in Linux to see board, still working on that.  
- Windows is pretty staightforward
